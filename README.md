# The Golem Network SDK documentation

## What is the golem network?

Golem Network is a decentralized marketplace where IT resources such as computation hardware are bought and sold. The network consists of two types of actors:

* **Requestor**

Has a need to use some IT resources such as computation hardware. Those resources are purchased in the decentralized market. The actual usage of the resources is backed by the Golem Network decentralized infrastructure.  

* **Provider**

Has IT resources that can be shared with other actors in the network. Those resources are sold in the decentralized market.

Both requestors and providers may be launched on different types of hardware. Those can be laptops, desktop computers, servers, and cloud environments. For the requestors, it is also feasible to be executed on mobile devices.

## How can I benefit?

There are two ways you can benefit on the Golem Network:

* **Develop a Golem Network based product**

Our decentralized stacks form a unique business value proposition your product can be based. Making Golem Network based product development being super easy is our core business. And there are no licensing fees. The details are described here:

* **Become a Golem Network provider**

If you have Internet-connected hardware that supports running Linux, you can install a Golem Network provider package and by sharing your hardware resources have a passive income stream straight to your [ethereum](https://ethereum.org/) address. Just follow this link:
