# The Golem SDK documentation

Looking for quick start? [Dive into our requestor development primer!](tutorials/flash-tutorial-of-requestor-development.md)
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
The current Alpha release of the new Golem is aimed at requestors. We'll be adding an ability to become a provider in one of the next reveals. If you'd like to provide computing power to Golem Network, [our Clay Golem Beta implementation](https://golem.network/products/clay-beta/) allows this.
{% endhint %}

## What is Golem?

{% hint style="info" %}
Golem is a global, open source, decentralized supercomputer that anyone can use. It is made up of the combined computing power of the users' machines, from PCs to entire data centers.
{% endhint %}

Under the hood, Golem is a decentralized marketplace where IT resources such as computation hardware are bought and sold. The actors in this decentralized network can assume one of the two nonexclusive profiles:

* **Requestor**

Has a need to use IT resources such as computation hardware. Those resources are purchased in the decentralized market. The actual usage of the resources is backed by Golem's decentralized infrastructure.  

* **Provider**

Has free IT resources that can be shared with other actors in the network. Those resources are sold in the decentralized market.

Both requestors and providers may be launched on different types of hardware. Those can be laptops, desktop computers, servers, and cloud environments. In case of requestors, it is also feasible for them to be executed on mobile devices.

## How can I benefit?

There are two ways you can benefit from Golem:

### **Develop a Golem-based product**

Our decentralized stacks form a unique business value proposition your product can be based on. 

{% hint style="info" %}
Ensuring that the development of products based on Golem is smooth and effortless is our core business.
{% endhint %}

 Plus, there are no licensing fees. The details are described here:

### **Become a Golem provider**

In the future if you have Internet-connected device running Linux, you can install a Golem Network provider package, share your hardware resources, and **have a passive income stream straight to your** [**ethereum**](https://ethereum.org/) **address**. 

## Golem is free and open source

{% hint style="info" %}
Golem is open-source software. All the code is available under the GPL license.
