# Service Example 2: Managed Erigon

The purpose of this example is to demonstrate building a Golem service using a dedicated, self-contained runtime. It features an Ethereum network client, Erigon (f.k.a. Turbo-geth) started on provider nodes on user's demand. Interaction with the service is *not* facilitated by Golem though.

{% hint style="info" %}
This example illustrates following Golem features & aspects:

* Dedicated service runtime implemented with [ya-runtime-sdk](https://github.com/golemfactory/ya-runtime-sdk)
* Service management using [yapapi-service-manager](https://github.com/golemfactory/yapapi-service-manager)
{% endhint %}
