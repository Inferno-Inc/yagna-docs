# The golem network

## What is the golem network?

Golem network is a decentralized marketplace where IT resources such as computation hardware are bought and sold. The network consists of two types of actors:

* **Requestor**

Has a need to use some IT resources such as computation hardware. Those resources are purchased in the decentralized market. The actual usage of the resources is backed by the golem network decentralized infrastructure.  

* **Provider**

Has IT resources that can be shared with other actors in the network. Those resources are sold in the decentralized market.

Both requestors and providers may be launched on different types of hardware. Those can be laptops, desktop computers, servers, and cloud environments. For the requestors, it is also feasible to be executed on mobile devices.
