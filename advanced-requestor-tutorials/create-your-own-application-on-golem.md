# Create your own application on golem

## Introduction

The use case for the Golem network is to be used by developers to create their own applications on Golem. The Golem platform and the Golem SDK are carefully crafted for this scenario.

This tutorial shows typical own application development with the Golem port of [Hashcat](https://hashcat.net/hashcat/) open source password cracking tool.

## Prerequisites

* Supported operating system
  * OS X 10.14+
  * Ubuntu 18.04 or 20.04
  * Windows 10
* Python 3.6+, git and yagna daemon installed, as described in 

{% page-ref page="../requestor-tutorials-1/flash-tutorial-of-requestor-development.md" %}

* Your own idea that can be implemented as running multiple docker images on golem providers. 

_Initially you can start just with experimenting with our example yacat - Golem_ [_Hashcat_](https://hashcat.net/hashcat/) _port._
